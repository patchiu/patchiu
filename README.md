- Hello, I am Patrick Chiu, a Math & Stat / IT Graduate . I love analytics, want to know why and how for everything. I am interested in data science and data analytics. It help me to find insight from the data. Using data to support me to do problem solving and decision making it make me feel safe. During my study, I learned some tools in data science , such as deep learning, optimization algorithms, regression analysis, statistical analysis etc. On the other hand, I have been learning some programming languages such as python and R in order to implement the above analysis. Besides my study, for my personality, I think I am a Systematic and Organized person.Usually, I like to set a schedule for me to finish something and A procedure to follow before I start. Which is to make sure I Know what I am doing and what I am going to do.
